A very early alpha, proof of concept, WIP, GUI front-end for Twnkl.

There are currently a few differences between the core source files of the GUI version and the console version, but these will be gone asap. My plan is to keep all source files compatible with either a console or gui build.

Basic editing of some data is possible, but there's not much error checking, so be warned!
